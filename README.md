    <summary> <b> Notes on this chapter </b></summary>

<h2>Notes on this chapter</h2>
<li><b>CBR </b> : Cost Benifit Ratio, the bigger the number the better is the project</li>
<li><b>Business Document</b> is where the outline of the project is stated</li>
<li><b>An assumption og</b> is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project  </li>
<li>The tool that is used for arranging a team with different skill set is a focus group, which is part of <b>Data Gathering</b>. <b>meeting</b> and “interpersonal and team skills” do not involve a focus group.</li>
<li>The <b>project management plan</b> contains the change management plan. Once a <b>change request</b>b> has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project manager will then execute the change in the <b>direct and manage project work process</b>b>
<li>Once a <b>Change  request</b>b> has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the <b>change log</b>b> to reflect the status of the change. </li> 
<li>Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the <b>close project or phase</b>b> process. </li>
<li> <b>Explicit knowledge</b> is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. <b>Tacit</b>b>* is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. </li>
<li>The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the <b>issue log</b>. From there, the PM can get a <b>change request</b> to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the **project management plan**.</li>
<li><b>The work performance data</b> will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done.</li>
<li>>The <b>project charter</b> is used to authorize a project.</li>
<li>The <b>project management plan</b> and <b>stakeholder register</b> come after the charter is created.</li>
<li>The <b>business documents</b> are an input to create project charters.</li>
<li>The <b>change management plan</b> is a part of the <b>project management plan</b> that will describes how to manage changes on a project. That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected.</li> 
<li>Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the <b>lesson learned register</b>. You should never stop working on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.</li>
<li>The <b>final report</b> is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project.</li>
<li><b>Trend analysis</b> is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. **Variance analysis** is only used to find a variance, not to predict it. </li>

# Scope Management 

```
PMBOK – “Includes the process required to ensure that the project includes all the work required and only the work 
required to complete the project successfully. Managing the project scope is primarily concerned with defining and 
controlling what is and what is not included in the project.”
