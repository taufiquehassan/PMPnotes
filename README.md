  </ul>

<b> Tools and Techniques:</b>

     <ul>
       <li> Formally authorizes the existence of the project and it assigns the Project Manager and their Authority Level </li>
       <li> Signed by the organization Senior Management </li>
       <li> High Level requirements & risks </li>
       <li> Preliminary Project Budget and Schedule </li>
       <li> Project Purpose or justification </li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li> <b> Assumption Log: </b> A list of things that you perceive to be true (assumptions) and things that might constrain the project. </li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> <b> 2. Planning: Develop Project Management Plan </b></summary>

<ul>
  <li> Process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all plan components and consolidating them into an integrated project management plan. </li>
  <li> Comprehensive document that outlines the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed </li>
  <li> Either summary or detailed </li>

## Monitor and Control Project Work - Output
* Change request 
* Work performance reports
* Project Management Plan updates
* Project Document updates

## Perform Integrated Change Control
"This is a hot topic, Anticipate lots of questions in the PMP exam"
1. Review all change requests
2. Communicating the decisions
3. Process where you assess the change's impact on the project
4. PM ultimately responsible for all changes
5. Any stakeholder may request change
6. **Change requests has to be in a written form
7. Change control board: Group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, decision making and communicating

## Change Control Process
* Process for making change
1. A stakeholder needs to indentify a need for a change
2. PM asses the change and look for any other options for the change request.  Looks for the impact of the change request.
3. The change request is submitted to the Change Control Board.
4. If approved, the PM will adjust the Project Management Plan, and then manage the the project to the new plan.
5. If it is not approved, the team goes back to the issue and develop a new change request, repeat step 1.


## Perform Integrated Change Control - Inputs
* Project Management Plan
* Project Documents
* Work Performance Report
* Change Requests  (this will be the main input)
* Entirprise Environment Factors
* Organizational Process Assets
* Export Judgement
* Meeting
* Data Analysis
* Change Control Tools
> To amanage the change requests, status, and resulting decisions\
> Update the stakeholder sith current information
* Approved Change Requests
> Once the change control board members approve a change requests, it will be implemented in the Direct and Manage Project Work process.
* Project Management Plan Updates
* Project Document updates
> change log

## Close Project or Phase
> This is the last process of integration. Before you do this prcess, the deliverable will have to be accepted.
* Finalize all activities.
* Making certain that all documents and deliverables are up-to-date and that all issues are resolved.
* Confirming the delivery and formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer
* Closing project accounts
* Reassing personal
* Confirming the formal acceptance of the seller's work
* Audit project success or failure
* Identify lesson learned, and archive project informaion for future use
* Transfer the project's products, services, or results to the next phase or production and/ operations
* Investigate and document the reasons for the actions taken if the project is terminated before completion.

## Notes on this chapter:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

* **CBR** : Benefit-Cost Ratio, the bigger the number the better is the project
* **Business Document** is where the outline of the project is stated
* **An assumption og** is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project 
* The tool that is used for arranging a team with different skill set is a focus group, which is part of **Data Gathering**. “Meeting” and “interpersonal and team skills” do not involve a focus group.
* The **project management plan** contains the change management plan. 
Once a **change request** has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project manager will then execute the change in the **direct and manage project work process**
* Once a **Change  request** has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the *change log* to reflect the status of the change. 
* Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the **close project or phase** process. 
* **Explicit knowledge** is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. **Tacit** is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. 
* The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the **issue log**. From there, the PM can get a **change request** to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the **project management plan**.
* **The work performance data** will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done.
* The **project charter** is used to authorize a project. 
* The **project management plan** and **stakeholder register** come after the charter is created. 
* The **business documents* are an input to create project charters.
* The **change management plan** is a part of the **project management plan** that will describes how to manage changes on a project. That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected. 
* Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the **lesson learned register**. 
* You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.
* The **final report** is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project. 
* **Trend analysis** is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. **Variance analysis** is only used to find a variance, not to predict it.
